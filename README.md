# IVM
Implementation and improvement methods for the Import Vector Machine (Zhu, Hastie 2001), interfaced entirely in Python and in one code file.

UPDATES:
IVM now interfaces using Class --> call functions as desired

IN PROGRESS: 
Multiclass classification via natural extension of KLR
- Phase out needed for OvR loops
